            <h4>I am a young college student beginning my studies at Brigham Young University-Idaho in the computer science
            field.  Through this program I am focusing on learning different programming languages, cyber security, and computer
            engineering fundamentals in order to thoroughly understand the Information Technology fields.  I am currently 
            pursuing an internship with Chick-fil-A IT and help improve the issues with the Chick-fil-A App and the frequent 
            IPOS glitches when using I-pads.  
                <br>While I love computer science I do have other interests!  I know it’s hard to believe but I enjoy being involved 
            in all aspects of performing arts.  In high school I began to learn the basics of lighting, sound, set, and costume 
            design and continued to apply these skills in productions.  My brother describes my other hobbies  as ‘old lady 
            skills’ as I crochet, bake, sew, embroider, sing, and dance.  It might also be because I care for my friends and 
            family in a ‘grandmotherly’ way but I could care less!  I simply will be the cool grannie in the old folks home.</br>
                The trait I value most is determination!.  Determination is defined as frim, resolute, and calculated efforts 
            towards your goals.  I am passionate about what I believe in and will do everything in my power to reach my goals.  
            I strive to be a compassionate wife and mother, an accomplished citizen of this great nation, an energetic 
            philanthropist, and a hard working woman in STEM.
