        Content

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        I am a young college student beginning my studies at Brigham Young University-Idaho in the computer science field.  Through this program I am focusing on learning different programing languages, cyber security, and computer engineering fundamentals in order to thoroughly understand the Information Technology fields.  I am currently pursuing an internship with Chick-fil-A IT and help improve the issues with the Chick-fil-A App and the frequent IPOS glitches when using I-pads.  
	While I love computer science I do have other interests!  I know it’s hard to believe but I enjoy being involved in all aspects of performing arts.  In high school I begun to learn the basics of lighting, sound, set, and costume design and continued to apply these skills in productions.  My brother describes my other hobbies  as ‘old lady skills’ as I crochet, bake, sew, embroider, sing, and dance.  It might also be because I care for my friends and family in a ‘grandmotherly’ way but I could care less!  I simply will be the cool grannie in the old folks home.
	I’ve often been asked to describe myself in one word and while my dear brothers might describe me as a nerd, a fartface, and the bestest, I prefer the word determined.  Determination is defined as frim, resolute, and calculated efforts towards your goals.  I am passionate about what I believe in and will do everything in my power to reach my goals.  I strive to be an compasionate wife and mother, an accomplished citizen of this great nation, a energetic philanthropist, and a successful woman in stem.

      <h3>Theatre</h3>
      <p>
        “I regard the theatre as the greatest of all art forms, the most immediate way in which a human being can share with another the sense of what it is to be a human being.”
-Thornton Wilder
	The arts is the backbone of civilization.  They are, after all, are greatest source of knowledge regarding the ancient world.  Written words, painted pots, and complex carvings, have given us knowledge of greek deieties, incan wars, and pharos reigns.  As these ancient works describe their culture the theatrical arts provide an unmatched ability to describe the very nature of man.  
	‘The nature of man never changes, merely the time and place.’(Mary Elizebeth King)  These wise words have driven my passion for performing arts and strengthened my ability to augment a complete reality on stage.  By embodying the aspects of humanity in each character I’ve played I have explored a range of human nature I had yet to discover.

      <h3>Achedemic and Service Projects</h3>
      <p>
